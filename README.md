this project contains a few files under the umbrella of the live fuel consumption model. this is a WIP for adding char oxidation to the pyrolysis model on main.

to run this file, a file containing stored variables ('solid_kinetics_v1.mat') is needed. this is a updated .mat file, the original being "ranzi_pyro_kinetics_gentile2017.mat". the newer file has kinetic properties for the new reactions.
