this project contains a few files under the umbrella of the live fuel consumption model. this is a WIP for adding char oxidation to the pyrolysis model on main.

to run this file, a file containing stored variables ('updated_kinetics_transport_props_creck.mat') is needed. this is a v2 .mat file, the original being "ranzi_pyro_kinetics_gentile2017.mat".
